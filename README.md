# metamask-brute-force
save the list of words to a note document, copy the file as path, and enter the file path where it says to in the brute force python file.
once both programs are running, bring the random word generator to cover the full left side of your screen, then bring up metamask on google chrome extention and pull that to fill the full right side of screen.
once configured, open the part where you enter the recovery phrase on metamask, scroll down to the bottom of the page and its set.
to start the program press (in order) insert ket, right arrow key, left arrow key, right arrow key, left arrow key, and then right arrow key.
then it will start brute forcing into the wallets, keep your finger on the end key because when it stops saying "invalid recovery phrase" the second that disapears hold the end key down.
after that just keep on pressing the right arrow key but not fast because you have to wait for it all to load so just press the arrow key when the next step is ready to be taken.
once you continue to press the arrow key youll find yourslef back to where the page scrolls down, this time the page should automatically scroll down with the press of the arrow key. 
then you rinse and repeat until you find a wallet. gl.
